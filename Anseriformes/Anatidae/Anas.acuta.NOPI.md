# Northern Pintail &nbsp; NOPI
**Anseriformes**<br>
**Anatidae**<br>
***Anas acuta***

## Basic Description
**Males** Elegant Northern Pintails swim through wetlands and lakes with their slender necks and long, pointed tails held high. **Females** Intricately patterned and pale-faced females join males fashioned with a signature white stripe down their chocolate-colored necks.

These eager breeders head to the prairie pothole region of the Great Plains, as well as Canada, and Alaska to nest as soon as the ice breaks up.

Large groups congregate in wetlands, lakes, bays, and even waddle through agricultural fields eating grains during the winter. Though still common, their populations are declining.
