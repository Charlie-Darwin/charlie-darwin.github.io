# American Wigeon &nbsp; AMWI
**Anseriformes**<br>
**Anatidae**<br>
***Mareca americana***

## Basic Descrption
- Quiet lakes and wetlands come alive with the breezy whistle of the American Wigeon, a dabbling duck with pizzazz.
- Breeding males have a green eye patch and a conspicuous white crown, earning them the nickname "baldpate."
- Females are brushed in warm browns with a gray-brown head and a smudge around the eye.
- Noisy groups congregate during fall and winter, plucking plants with their short gooselike bill from wetlands and fields or nibbling plants from the water's surface. Despite being common their populations are declining.
