# Northern Pintail &nbsp; NOPI
**Anseriformes**<br>
**Anatidae**<br>
***Anas acuta***

## Basic Description
- Elegant Northern Pintails swim through wetlands and lakes with their slender necks and long, pointed tails held high.
- Intricately patterned and pale-faced females join males fashioned with a signature white stripe down their chocolate-colored necks.
- These eager breeders head to the prairie pothole region of the Great Plains, as well as Canada, and Alaska to nest as soon as the ice breaks up.
- Large groups congregate in wetlands, lakes, bays, and even waddle through agricultural fields eating grains during the winter. Though still common, their populations are declining.
